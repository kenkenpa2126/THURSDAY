# T.H.U.R.S.D.A.Y.
This is **T**ext en**H**anced **U**ser suppo**R**t **S**ystem day by **DAY**, a desktop chat application to support your daily work. 
Using OpenAI API and LangChain, AI will answer your questions using documents stored in the user's local environment and web searches.

One point of differentiation from ChatGPT is that it can read the documents in the user's local environment and answer the question, retrieving the document related to it. 
In addition, we are aiming to develop a chat system that can be more deeply personalized for each individual, based on user information with long-term memory among multiple sessions.

**Now(2023/10/29), it only can read the documents under "pdf" directries in the backend repository. So, you have to place the documents in the "pdf" repository or upload them.
In addition, you have to say "pdf" at the beggining of the question to ask about the documents. (like in the fig.)**

## Status
### Current Status (2023/10/29)
Now, it has two functions.

1. To answer the given question about a document, which starts with word "pdf", that the user uploaded. (like the first question in the fig)
2. To answer the given quesiotn searching web.

### Future Works
1. Enable it to read texts sotred in any local repositories.
2. Enable it to read any kinds of documents such as .doc, .ppt, .md etc.
3. Enable it to chose whether it should search web or retrieve pdf, depending on the context.
4. Enable it to have the long-term memory that spans multiple sessions and chat with user; longditudnal dialogue (LD).
5. Enable it to extract user information and personalize to the each user.
